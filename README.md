As i was trying to work with tasks switching them from active and completed i found that writing
with only functions made the switching weird in a way where if i checked a task it wouldnt instantly go to completed 
tasks tab so i learned about usestates and implemented them in my code. Also i found working with bootsrap react made
designing hard for me as you can see it is very simple but i made sure to implement everything asked.a
